ESP-IDF RAK811 Implementation
====================

This is a very simple implementation to use the RAK811 with the ESP32. It is currently in the process of getting builded up. It currently supports sending "legacy" AT commands to the module and putting and retreive it from sleep mode.

In future this component should get all important functions as full C API.
